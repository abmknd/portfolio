<h3>A design generalist committed to pushing the boundaries of impactful digital experiences and unraveling design secrets along the way, I have a history of helping brands and people discover their raison d’être, while using strategy and research to help them become super fit to take on their respective target markets. When I’m not busy obsessing over a new object of curiosity, I am busy reading books, watching movies, drawing, writing, video gaming, listening to highlife, or watching animes being a cat’s human.</h3>
